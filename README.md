# Data Engineering Project / Youtube Data Analysis

## 1. Description of the Problem:
Today, analysts use historical data from platforms like YouTube to build predictive models for better user engagement and smarter decision-making. But these models face challenges due to the changing nature of online video consumption, which can be influenced by trends, world events, and audience preferences.

Moreover, when dealing with global data, complexities arise due to cultural and regional variations in content consumption. Hence, it's important to combine data analysis with current context and trends to drive better business decisions.

## 2. Objective:
Historical YouTube data is a rich resource for content creators, marketers, and analysts, helping them understand audience habits, predict content demand, and formulate content strategies.

These datasets can also optimize content recommendations and planning, and guide strategic decisions for platforms like YouTube. Plus, they provide academic and research opportunities, allowing exploration of viewer behavior and the influence of video platforms on global media consumption.

A typical YouTube dataset, available as .csv files or via APIs, includes various engagement metrics but has limitations. It captures historical trends but may not predict sudden changes or account for local contexts. Therefore, it's essential to consider these limitations when using this data. Moreover, we must handle this data responsibly, ensuring user anonymity and data privacy. This project aims to analyze YouTube data using AWS and visualize the results, helping uncover patterns and insights into user behavior and content performance on YouTube.
